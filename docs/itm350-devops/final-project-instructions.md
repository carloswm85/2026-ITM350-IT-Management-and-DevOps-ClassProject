== WEEK 12-14 - FINAL PROJECT ==

== PURPOSE =================================================

Apply all principles within the course to the team repository by building a team
project and deploying it to AWS without logging into AWS. Upon completion of this
project, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate proficiency in Git for version control by effectively implementing
  branching strategies, conducting code reviews, and collaborating in a team
  environment.
- Implement automated unit and integration testing to enhance software quality,
  maintainability, and long-term reliability.
- Create, deploy, and manage containerized applications in a cloud environment
  to improve scalability, reliability, and resource efficiency.
- Design and implement automated Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment
  (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline software delivery and deployment processes.
- Utilize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to define, provision, and manage cloud
  infrastructure programmatically
 
== TASKS ===================================================

Your goal is to build and release your application without logging into AWS.

Do the following in your team repositories

- Create a team repository
- Minimum requirements:
  - Use Github
  - Includes unit and integration tests
  - Docker image pushed to Docker Hub
  - Build pipeline
  - Release pipeline
  - Infrastructure as code (this should be ran in the release pipeline). Submit
    a final project report (this should be written as if you were submitting this
    to your boss at the end of an internship). Report should include the
    following:
    - Detailed description of your project and the problem that it is solving
    - URL of your EC2 where your application is successfully running
    - Screenshot of your application successfully running 
    - URL of your code base
    - URL of your docker image in docker hub
